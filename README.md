schedule-analyzer
=================

Gets, processes and analyzes the possible schedules for a student of the Faculty of Sciences, UNAM. The selection is based on the desired subjects and desired groups. The user interface is none (sorry) because I intended to use only for my purposes, but any help with that is welcome! BTW, I am no longer a student at the abovementioned Faculty (I've finished the BSc), so I will probably not update this anymore.
